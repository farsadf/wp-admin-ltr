# WP Admin LTR
Do you use an RTL edition of WordPress? Without any doubt, it's the must powerful & the best free and open-sourced blogging engine out there. But if you use it as an RTL user you will notice that some plugins and themes are not RTL ready by default and make dashboard look terrible. So I decided to write a plugin for fixing this problem. As a quick-fix, i decided to load an unmodified version of the page in LTR and show it to the end-user so, I wrote this plugin and published it to GitHub to help the RTL community to take full advantage of whatever they are using in WordPress platform.
